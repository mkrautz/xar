	* CHANGELOG: Added changelog
	* include/xar.h.in src/xar.c lib/util.c: moved helper functions for retrieving and formating file properties such as size, mode, mtime, etc. from src/xar.c to lib/util.c and exported them in xar.h.
	* lib/err.c lib/archive.h: Added the xar_t archive context to the error handler context to be able to retrieve archive level context within an error, such as archive level options, or being able to examine other files than the one the error occurred on.
	* lib/strmode.h lib/util.c config.h.in configure.ac: Import strmode(3) from freebsd to handle the formatting of file mode in xar_get_mode(), used for displaying file mode from xar -tvf.  configure will automatically detect whether to use the OS strmode(3) or the included copy.

	* include/xar.h.in src/xar.c src/xar.1 lib/stat.c: Only extract setuid/setgid bits if the user/group are the same as the archived file (if -p/-P are specified on the command line) OR if the newly added --keep-setuid flag is specified.
	* configure.ac lib/stat.c: Fix the autoconf test for ino_t size, and switch the inode and device number printf's to use the autogenerated INO_STRING and DEV_STRING to get the correct formatting parameter.

	* CHANGELOG: Added changelog
	* include/xar.h.in src/xar.c lib/util.c: moved helper functions for retrieving and formating file properties such as size, mode, mtime, etc. from src/xar.c to lib/util.c and exported them in xar.h.
	* lib/err.c lib/archive.h: Added the xar_t archive context to the error handler context to be able to retrieve archive level context within an error, such as archive level options, or being able to examine other files than the one the error occurred on.
	* lib/strmode.h lib/util.c config.h.in configure.ac: Import strmode(3) from freebsd to handle the formatting of file mode in xar_get_mode(), used for displaying file mode from xar -tvf.  configure will automatically detect whether to use the OS strmode(3) or the included copy.
